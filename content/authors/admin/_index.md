Welcome to the homepage of Lateefah Al-Naimi. I'm a Computer Science PhD Student at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I am currently working on the analysis of the metagenomic data of bacteriophages at CU Boulder's [Living Matter Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/living-matter-lab). My research interests include human-computer interaction, bioinformatics, and social computing.
