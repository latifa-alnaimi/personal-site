## Overview
I developed the Aquarium of Morality for a Virtual Reality class. Watch as your actions –good or bad– alter your magical aquarium. Positive actions will cause it to flourish while negative ones cause it to decay.

## Description
Users are placed in a setting they can explore and interact with. Actions they perform are evaluated as good or bad and kept track of with a point system. The manifestation of these actions take effect on an aquarium. To keep it alive and grow it further, users must perform typically constructive actions. The more positive actions, the more the aquarium will develop –and vice versa for destructive actions.
