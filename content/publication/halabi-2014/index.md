abstract: This work aims to design and develop an optimal vibrotactile seat to provide
  a high level of satisfaction to the driver. The main critical design parameters
  were considered and experiments were conducted to investigate the proper values
  of voltage, frequency, and amplitude that are specifically related to the developed
  haptic seat.
