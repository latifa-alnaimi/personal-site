abstract: Using multisensory signals in advanced driver assistance is continuously
  increasing as a way to increase the attention and reduce the reaction time. It is
  essential that driver assistance system is capable of providing directional cues
  to the driver to direct his attention to the sides of the car as usually the focus
  is in front of the car. These signals could be for blind spot information, navigation,
  lane departure warning, collision warning, etc. This study investigated the effect
  of auditory and vibrotactile on directional attention in driver assistance systems.
  Moreover, two types of immersive displays were used in the driving simulation, namely
  the Head Mounted Display (HMD) and CAVE display, to study the effect of the type
  of display on the human performance. Lane Chang Task was used to assess the attention
  by measuring the response time to directional information. Vibrotactile and Auditory
  cues induced equal response times, meanwhile, vibrotactile signal was significantly
  gained higher satisfaction than auditory.
