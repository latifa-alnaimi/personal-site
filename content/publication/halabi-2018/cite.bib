 abstract = {Using multisensory signals in advanced driver assistance is continuously increasing as a way to increase the attention and reduce the reaction time. It is essential that driver assistance system is capable of providing directional cues to the driver to direct his attention to the sides of the car as usually the focus is in front of the car. These signals could be for blind spot information, navigation, lane departure warning, collision warning, etc. This study investigated the effect of auditory and vibrotactile on directional attention in driver assistance systems. Moreover, two types of immersive displays were used in the driving simulation, namely the Head Mounted Display (HMD) and CAVE display, to study the effect of the type of display on the human performance. Lane Chang Task was used to assess the attention by measuring the response time to directional information. Vibrotactile and Auditory cues induced equal response times, meanwhile, vibrotactile signal was significantly gained higher satisfaction than auditory.},
