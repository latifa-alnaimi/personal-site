abstract = {Driving simulations are widely used to send navigational and warning information to help drivers navigate safely. The traditional approaches are to use visual and auditory channels which can cause sensory overloading. Haptic has major safety implication on reducing visual and auditory overloading in driving, and since seats are the largest area in touch with the driver's body, it is a sensible choice to consider for delivering the haptic information. This paper presents the design and development of an optimal vibrotactile seat to provide a high level of satisfaction to the driver. The seat was designed by experimenting with different design parameters such as the intensity, position, and the rhythm of vibrations. Experiments were conducted to investigate the proper values of voltage, frequency, and amplitude that are specifically related to the developed haptic seat. A driving simulation was developed to evaluate the haptic seat for vehicle navigation in an immersive virtual driving simulator. Results showed that users preferred the vibrations to the audio feedback.},

abstract = {Single parents often suffer from financial difficulties, loneliness and a lack of social support. The latter in particular leaves single parents vulnerable to stress, which can lead to the development of psychological disorders such as depression. We created the app, ParentCircle, as a low-cost solution to encourage physical interaction between parents in social spaces, and thus, help them build an effective support network. They can share announcements, chat, and are encouraged to form lasting, real world relationships. ParentCircle also offers parents the ability to join various community groups, which provide information about local news, and events to take part in with their children. It differs from existing products and apps, because it actively encourages and facilitates physical interaction, with the intention of helping single parents build a support network which will ease the various burdens they experience.},

abstract = {Using multisensory signals in advanced driver assistance is continuously increasing as a way to increase the attention and reduce the reaction time. It is essential that driver assistance system is capable of providing directional cues to the driver to direct his attention to the sides of the car as usually the focus is in front of the car. These signals could be for blind spot information, navigation, lane departure warning, collision warning, etc. This study investigated the effect of auditory and vibrotactile on directional attention in driver assistance systems. Moreover, two types of immersive displays were used in the driving simulation, namely the Head Mounted Display (HMD) and CAVE display, to study the effect of the type of display on the human performance. Lane Chang Task was used to assess the attention by measuring the response time to directional information. Vibrotactile and Auditory cues induced equal response times, meanwhile, vibrotactile signal was significantly gained higher satisfaction than auditory.},
