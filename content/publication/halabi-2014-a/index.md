abstract: Driving simulations are widely used to send navigational and warning information
  to help drivers navigate safely. The traditional approaches are to use visual and
  auditory channels which can cause sensory overloading. Haptic has major safety implication
  on reducing visual and auditory overloading in driving, and since seats are the
  largest area in touch with the driver's body, it is a sensible choice to consider
  for delivering the haptic information. This paper presents the design and development
  of an optimal vibrotactile seat to provide a high level of satisfaction to the driver.
  The seat was designed by experimenting with different design parameters such as
  the intensity, position, and the rhythm of vibrations. Experiments were conducted
  to investigate the proper values of voltage, frequency, and amplitude that are specifically
  related to the developed haptic seat. A driving simulation was developed to evaluate
  the haptic seat for vehicle navigation in an immersive virtual driving simulator.
  Results showed that users preferred the vibrations to the audio feedback.
