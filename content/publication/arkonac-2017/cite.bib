 abstract = {Single parents often suffer from financial difficulties, loneliness and a lack of social support. The latter in particular leaves single parents vulnerable to stress, which can lead to the development of psychological disorders such as depression. We created the app, ParentCircle, as a low-cost solution to encourage physical interaction between parents in social spaces, and thus, help them build an effective support network. They can share announcements, chat, and are encouraged to form lasting, real world relationships. ParentCircle also offers parents the ability to join various community groups, which provide information about local news, and events to take part in with their children. It differs from existing products and apps, because it actively encourages and facilitates physical interaction, with the intention of helping single parents build a support network which will ease the various burdens they experience.},
