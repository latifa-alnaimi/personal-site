abstract: Single parents often suffer from financial difficulties, loneliness and
  a lack of social support. The latter in particular leaves single parents vulnerable
  to stress, which can lead to the development of psychological disorders such as
  depression. We created the app, ParentCircle, as a low-cost solution to encourage
  physical interaction between parents in social spaces, and thus, help them build
  an effective support network. They can share announcements, chat, and are encouraged
  to form lasting, real world relationships. ParentCircle also offers parents the
  ability to join various community groups, which provide information about local
  news, and events to take part in with their children. It differs from existing products
  and apps, because it actively encourages and facilitates physical interaction, with
  the intention of helping single parents build a support network which will ease
  the various burdens they experience.
